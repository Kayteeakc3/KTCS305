Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis financial is a client of Global rain, a software engineering company. Global rain specializes in custom software development. Artemis financial specializes in financial plans such as savings, retirement, and insurance for its customers. Artmeis has a public web interface and would like to use the most current and strict software security. They are seeking Global Rains help on how to securely protect client data and financial information. Artemis would like to add a verification step to its web application to ensure secure transmission using a checksum. 

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I was able to successfully run a dependency report to display vulnerabilities within the application. The importance to code securely affects the overall use of the application. If the code written is not secure, it opens the applications up to hackers to exploit and steal protected data from customers. Secure code and stringent software security greatly affects a companys reputation with its customers. If the customers data cannot be protected in a secure manner, then data can be stolen and customers finanical well being with the company is damaged. 

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging part of the assessment to me was trying to determine which vulnerabilities were false positives. It took a great deal of work and investigation to determine which vulnerabilities were legit. Each one had to be investigated and that was challenging as well when trying to find all the information you could about the vulnerability. Although reading the vulnerabilities were quite helpful in that it helped me to understand what is dependant for the application to function properly. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I througoughly reviewed the written code as well as the input data to ensure the code was secure enough for the application to run. I also removed vulnerabilities that were regarded as low importance and outdated versions of vulnerabilities. I would continue to use owasp to assess vulnerabilties as it seems it is the most widely used and up to date dependancy check. When deciding mitigation techniques it is wise to review all necessary information gathered on owasp to ensure false positives are properly removed from the dependency check. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I reviewed the code multiple times to ensure proper coding techniques, resolved any errors within Eclipse that was preventing the code to function. After adjusting the code, I was able to run a correct dependency report and review the application functionality

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Resources such as owasp and the dependency check were veru useful when investigating code security. For future projects I would recommend using an alternate source to discover the meaning of the vulnerabilites detected by the check. It was difficult to determine the false positives. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would be most proud to show my work from Project one. I was able to successfully run the check and remove vulnerabilities and then rerun the check again.
